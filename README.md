About PROVEN
=====================================
PROVEN is general and efficient framework to **PRO**babilistic **VE**rify **N**eural network robustness -- it certifies the probability that the classifier's top-1 prediction can't be altered under any constrained Lp norm perturbation to a given input. 

* PROVEN is **general** and **efficient**: it can be directly built on top of existing neural network robustness verification algorithms including [Fast-Lin](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09699), [CROWN](https://github.com/IBM/CROWN-Robustness-Certification) and the latest [CNN-Cert](https://github.com/AkhilanB/CNN-Cert) to efficiently certify robustness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with little computation overhead.
